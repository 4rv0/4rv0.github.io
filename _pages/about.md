Hi I'm 4rv0. I'm a hacker and security researcher who lives somewhere in the Pacific Northwest of the USA. I've been messing around with computers and networks since the mid-1980s, professionally since 1995, and I finally decided to start writing down all the thoughts that go racing around my head.

I hope you find something interesting here.
