So while it may seem a bit obvious to start off a 
hacking blog talking about Defcon, I'm going to 
try to take a little bit different approach to the 
whole thing, since I think that it's pretty easy
nowadays to find a lot of blogs, articles, podcasts,
and videos talking about the basics.

By basics, I mean things like dealing with the heat,
deciding what tech and other gear to 
bring, and coming to grips with whatever dangers
you might be worried about.

I'm going to offer some practical advice
on some topics that I haven't seen covered as much, 
from the perspective of someone who has been
attending Defcon (and occasionally Blackhat, and 
BSidesLV, and Queercon, etc) for a long time.

## Getting a hotel room 
If this is your first Defcon and/or related events, 
decide very shortly after it's over this year if you 
want to attend again.  If you do - book your preferred
hotel ASAP.  

It will be much much cheaper to book a room immediately
after the con.  Most Vegas hotels have 72 hour cancellation
policies.  If you change your mind later, it's not a big deal.

If it turns out that you want to get into a room block
at a hotel that is discounted because it's on the "official 
list" of Defcon hotels, it's easy to call them up and 
have the reservation changed to be part of the room block.

If you wait until the "last minute" - like maybe a month
or two before the con, you will be getting into the part
where the hotels STEEPLY jack up their prices, and all
the room block rooms will be filled.  

My total hotel expenses this year will be about $138/night,
because I'm taking advantage of a room rate,
and because I made my reservation early and extended it 
through Defcon.  As of the time of this post, 
the few available rooms at the larger, strip hotels are going for 
as much as $600 a night.  

Don't wait, book early. You can always cancel if your plans 
change.

## Having a place to chill
I have found that for me, at least, staying at an offstrip,
smaller hotel is better than being in the thick of the action.
I like having a place I can escape to, where going down to
the hotel lobby to get a bite to eat won't mean entering
into a massive throng of people, and/or waiting a long time
to get a seat and a meal.

I have also found that the off strip places are often
a little more mellow than the strip - fewer rowdy drunks, less
craziness. I appreciate that, and appreciate being able 
to strike up a conversation with the bartender, or 
some older gent who is just there to play a little video
poker and relax. For me this is a curative to the sensory overload 
of Defcon.

## Being kind to yourself
Some people can handle being in a noisy crowd of 30,000 people
for long periods of time. 

I cannot. Know thyself.

If you're the sort of person who finds the energy and chaos
of that many people exciting, that's great. If you're someone 
more like me, that's great too.  Figure out how you can treat
yourself well, based on who you are and what you like.

Also, as I've gotten older, I've found that in order to enjoy
myself, I need adequate sleep, adequate alone time, adequate
food, and adequate exercise.  I probably needed all that when I was 
younger but my youthful resiliance allowed me to power through;
I still felt like shit later, but somehow I thought it was worth it.

I don't think it was, now. This is again just my take - but 
when the choices arise about what you should be doing in the 
wee small hours, I strongly encourage you to prioritize your
tomorrow self. 

## If you're not feeling it, it's OK
If you find yourself being bored, or annoyed, or stressed
at Defcon, all that means is that you aren't finding the 
right part of it for you. By all means, give yourself
permission to bail and go somewhere else. 

Go chill out in the chillout area. Find a different village 
to investigate, or a different talk 
track to pop into, or a different party to go to, or 
maybe even just go find somewhere completely out of the 
way to take a breath and reset. Vegas is actually full
of fun things to do and if you find yourself feeling 
tired, or not having fun, it is ABSOLUTELY ok to bail.

Take a break. Maybe even a long one. Come back tomorrow
and give it another shot.

You are not missing anything - or rather, it's so huge
that _everyone_ is missing something at all times. 
Don't let the FOMO make you have a bad time.

## Why do I come back year after year?
A few reasons - some of it is that I have friends I get to 
see at Defcon and pretty much nowhere else. We all lead
such busy lives.

But also - I learn things, and I get to see neat stuff, 
and talk to people who are passionate and excited about 
the stuff they're doing and learning, and that re-energizes
me and reminds me why I got into this all those years 
ago. It's a yearly pick-me-up for my motivation.

That's what it's all about for me; relationships, learning, and inspiration. 
Come into it looking to have great conversations, learn things, and
get excited, and you won't go too far wrong.

Maybe I'll run into you sometime.  That would be cool.
