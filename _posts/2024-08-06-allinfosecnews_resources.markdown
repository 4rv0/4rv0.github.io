Just a quick post, since I'm currently at [BSidesLV](https://bsideslv.org), where it's somehow 113 degrees Fahrenheit. 

About a year ago I found [All Infosec News](https://allinfosecnews.com) and I found it extremely useful. It is (was) a news aggregator, essentially an RSS feed of a lot of resources with some capabilities for sorting and the like.

They're shutting down...

but they've done a great thing and put the list of sources they were using on github at [https://github.com/foorilla/allinfosecnews_sources](https://github.com/foorilla/allinfosecnews_sources).

While I'm sorry to see this resource go, this data will make my RSS reader very happy, after I get it all in there.
