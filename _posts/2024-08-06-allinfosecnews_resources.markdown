Just a quick post, since I'm currently at [BSidesLV](https://bsideslv.org), where it's somehow 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Unfortunately,
the really valuable information security news aggregator [All Infosec News](https://allinfosecnews.com) shut down this month, 
but they've provided a list of the sources they used.

They put the sources they were using in a markdown README file at [https://github.com/foorilla/allinfosecnews_sources](https://github.com/foorilla/allinfosecnews_sources).

To make things easier on myself I coded up a small script to pull out the data from the README and put it into OPML format so that RSS readers could import the links easily.

You can find the code, and the OPML file generated, at the repo [allinfosecnews2opml](https://github.com/4rv0/allinfosecnews2opml)

Enjoy!
